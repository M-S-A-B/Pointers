Title: Pointers

Aim: To learn Object oriented programming in C++

Theory: Pointers are symbolic representations of addresses. They enable programs to simulate call-by-reference as well as to create and manipulate dynamic data structures. 
Iterating over elements in arrays or other data structures is one of the main use of pointers. 
The address of the variable youâ€™re working with is assigned to the pointer variable that points to the same data type (such as an int or string).

SYNTAX:
datatype *var_name; 
int *ptr;   // ptr can point to an address which holds int data

Using a Pointer:
1)Define a pointer variable
2)Assigning the address of a variable to a pointer using the unary operator (&) which returns the address of that variable.
3)Accessing the value stored in the address using unary operator (*) which returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand.


Algorithm:

Start =>  declare pointer and array => point the pointer to the first[0 index] element of the array => take input from user of index to print the element => 
using pointer print the element by incrementing the pointer address  =>  End


Explanation of the algorithm:

We declare a pointer and an array. Then point the pointer to the first[0 index] element of the array. Then take input of index to print, from user. 
Then by incrementing pointers address value accordingly, we print the required element.
